### Update
It's strange to look back at my own code from 3 years ago as I near the end of my time at Turing. Now that I understand and can implement the pillars of OOP in my code, the functions I wrote in this project look a kindergartener's poem on a fridge. However, I am not at all embarassed by the work here. My prediction algorithm is actually pretty decent, due to my attention to detail. And the deployed app is pretty cool. But mostly, this reminds me how much I've elevated my skills at Turing. I am not writing like the Shakespeare of programming yet, but I am improving rapidly and show no signs of slowing down.

## Welcome

This repository contains all the relevant files for the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization Capstone Project.

- **textPredictor** directory contains the *ui.r* and *server.r* files for the text prediction application, which was created in RStudio using the Shiny package. The application can be viewed at [fentontaylor.shinyapps.io/textPredictor/](https://fentontaylor.shinyapps.io/textPredictor/).
- *modelTraining.R* contains all the code to fully reproduce the data splitting and N-gram list creation.
- *functions.R* contains all the custom functions implemented in model training.
- *MilestoneReport1.Rmd* is the first assignment for the project and performs initial exploratory analysis. The compiled HTML version of the code can be viewed at [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/fentontaylor/251753).
- *capstonePresentation.md* is the reproducible pitch of the application. HTML version can be viewed [here](http://rpubs.com/fentontaylor/261942).
